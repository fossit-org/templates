# Markdown templates
Some standard templates to help everyone get started with Github and software documentation. We will focus on writing the documentation in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/) as it is easy to learn and widely adopted.

## How to use
You are free to use the templates provided in the `docs/` directory. Each file describes its contents through the file name, however you are free to name these files in your project. The purpose of the files have listed down below:

- `docs/`
    - `commit.md`: Some cues as to how you should frame your commit messages to make it easier for developers, contributors, code reviewers to understand what you did in that particular commit.
    - `pullrequests.md`: The description of pull requests can save a lot of time for the reviewers and contributors. This document has some points you can check in your own description to see if the pull request is ready.
    - `readme.md`: Every repository has a README.md for everyone to find a starting point for the package / software you have published. This template will help you cover all the things you can tell about the project
    - `developersdoc.md`: Some important ideas you might want to convey to the developers and contributors to make it easy for them to navigate through the code and contribute.
